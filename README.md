# eggpuzzle
This is a eightpuzzle game written in C++ with player mode.

The objective of this game is to arrange the number ascending by moving the dots around.<br />
Users are restricted to move only in 4 directions (up, down, left right) in 9 boxes.<br />
The sequence of numbers will be randomly generated by a seed inputed by the user.<br />

If the user can succesfully arrange the numbers, it will show well done! and game over.
